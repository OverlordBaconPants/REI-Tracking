- Document all modules, classes, and functions with docstrings.
- Use [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

### Testing

#### Backend Tests
Run backend tests with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=src
```

#### Frontend Tests
The project includes a comprehensive frontend testing framework for JavaScript components:

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
cd tests/test_frontend
./run_tests.py

# Run a specific test file
./run_tests.py --test-file test_minimal.py

# Run tests with verbose output
./run_tests.py --verbose

# Run tests with browser visible (not headless)
./run_tests.py --no-headless

# Generate HTML report
./run_tests.py --html-report

# Generate coverage report
./run_tests.py --coverage
```

The frontend testing framework uses:
- **pytest** as the test runner
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation
- **Chrome** (headless by default) as the browser for testing

All required dependencies for frontend testing are included in the main project's `requirements.txt` file. For more details, see the [Frontend Testing README](tests/test_frontend/README.md).

### Git Workflow

#### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/bug-name`
- Release branches: `release/version`

#### Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").
- Keep the first line under 50 characters.
- Provide more details in the commit body if necessary.

### Deployment

#### Production Setup

1. Set up a production server with Python 3.9 or higher.
2. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file with production settings.
4. Set up a WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) to run the application.
5. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle requests.

#### Environment Variables

- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production` for production environment.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secure random string for session encryption.
- `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY`: API key for Geoapify services.
- `RENTCAST_API_KEY`: API key for Rentcast services.
